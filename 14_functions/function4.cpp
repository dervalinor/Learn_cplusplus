/*
How Return Values Work
When functions have a return type other than void, the function has two new requirements:

There must be a value returned from the function.
The return value must be the same type as the functionâ€™s return type.
But where does the return value get returned to?

It gets returned to the place where the function is called. For example, if you have the following function:

std::string feed_the_cat() {
 
  return "Cat is fed!";
 
}
And then print the function call inside of main():

int main() {
 
  std::string cat_message = feed_the_cat();
  std::cout << cat_message;
 
}
The return value of the function is what gets printed to the terminal.

Instructions
Watch how make_sandwich() passes its return value back to the function call in main().
*/

#include <iostream>

std::string make_sandwich(){
  return "Take your sandwich";
}

int main(){
  std::cout << make_sandwich() << "\n";
}
